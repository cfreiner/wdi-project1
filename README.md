# Mixmath

## Description
Browser implementation of the board game Mixmath, originally published by Wrebbit in 1987. Production of the board game has since been discontinued. If you like math, this could be a fun game to play. Alternatively, you could force your children to play it as a form of punishment.

## How to Play

### Getting started
Enter the names of at least 2 players. Click start game.

### Playing tiles
Click a tile in your rack, then click an open space on the game board. Click submit move. If you selected a legal move, then your tile will be placed on the board. Placed tiles must be the solution to an arithmetic equation consisting of two adjacent tiles.  The adjacent tiles can be to the left or right, or above or below the placed tile.  For example, if a 1 and a 2 are next to each other on the board, a 2 can be placed on either side of the pair, because 1*2=2.  Alternatively, a 1 or a 3 would also be a legal move (2-1=1, 1+2=3). Tiles placed on squares with an arithmetic symbol must be the solution to an equation using that symbol. After placing a tile on a square with a symbol, the player immediately draws a new tile.

### Scoring
Players are awarded points equal to the value of each tile they place. If a tile is placed on a multiplier square, the value of the tile is multiplied by that multiplier. If a tile is the solution to equations in multiple directions, then it is multiplied by the number of equations that it solves. For example, imagine there are two 2's, then an open space, then two more 2's on the board. A 4 placed in the open space solves equations on both sides, so it would be worth 8 points.

### Ending the turn
A player's turn is over when they have played all their tiles, have no legal moves left, or they decide to pass the turn. After their turn, the player draws tiles back to the max of 7.  The game is over when there are no tiles left in the pool and no players have legal moves left, or if all players pass the turn consecutively.
